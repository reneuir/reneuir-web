# Call for Papers

ReNeuIR will be held at SIGIR 2022 and, as with the main conference,
is planned as a hybrid event—in person in Madrid, Spain, with support
for remote participation.

In addition to the workshop, we have initiated a process for authors
of selected papers to submit an extended version of their work to a
special issue of an international journal. We will release more
information as we obtain the necessary approval.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on the following topics, including but not limited to:

* Novel NIR models that reach competitive quality but are designed
to provide fast training or fast inference;

* Efficient NIR models for decentralized IR tasks such as conversational search;

* Strategies to speed up training or inference of existing NIR models;

* Sample-efficient training of NIR models;

* Efficiency-driven distillation, pruning, quantization,
retraining, and transfer learning;

* Empirical investigation and justification of the complexity
of existing NIR models through an analysis of quality,
interpretability, or robustness; and

* Evaluation protocols for efficiency in NIR.

## Important Dates

Submission deadline: **Friday, April 22, 2022**

Notification of acceptance: **Monday, May 23, 2022**

Workshop: **Friday, Jul 15, 2022**
