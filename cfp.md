# Call for Papers

ReNeuIR will be held at SIGIR 2022 and, as with the main conference,
is planned as a hybrid event—in person in Madrid, Spain, with support
for remote participation.

In addition to the workshop, we have initiated a process for authors
of selected papers to submit an extended version of their work to a
special issue of an international journal. We will release more
information as we obtain the necessary approval.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on the following topics, including but not limited to:

* Novel NIR models that reach competitive quality but are designed
to provide fast training or fast inference;

* Efficient NIR models for decentralized IR tasks such as conversational search;

* Strategies to speed up training or inference of existing NIR models;

* Sample-efficient training of NIR models;

* Efficiency-driven distillation, pruning, quantization,
retraining, and transfer learning;

* Empirical investigation and justification of the complexity
of existing NIR models through an analysis of quality,
interpretability, or robustness; and

* Evaluation protocols for efficiency in NIR.

## Important Dates

Submission deadline: ~~Friday, April 22, 2022~~ **Sunday, May 8, 2022** (Extended)

Notification of acceptance: **Friday, June 10, 2022**

Workshop: **Friday, Jul 15, 2022**

All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h (“anywhere on Earth”).

## Submission Guidelines and Review Process

All submissions will go through a single-blind peer review process
by the program committee and judged on the basis of their relevance
to the theme of the workshop. All submissions must be in English and
formatted according to the latest ACM SIG proceedings template.
Authors must refer to the SIGIR Call for Papers for more information.

Unlike the main conference we do NOT require submissions to be anonymous.
Furthermore, as we do not publish accepted papers in the conference proceedings,
we welcome extensions or revisions of published articles and those pending publication.

Articles may be between 4 and 9 pages long, excluding references.

Submissions should be made electronically
via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=reneuir2022)
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=reneuir2022).
