# Call for Papers

The second workshop on Reaching Efficiency in Neural Information Retrieval (ReNeuIR)
will be held at SIGIR 2023 and, as with the main conference, is planned as a hybrid
event—in person in Taipei, Taiwan, with support for remote participation.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome both "full" and "poster" submissions on the following topics,
including but not limited to:

* Novel Neural IR (NIR) models that reach competitive quality but are designed to provide fast training or fast inference;
* Efficient NIR models for decentralized IR tasks such as conversational search; 
* Strategies to speed up training or inference of existing NIR models; 
* Sample-efficient training of NIR models; 
* Efficiency-driven distillation, pruning, quantization, retraining, and transfer learning; 
* Empirical investigation of the complexity of existing NIR models through an analysis of quality, interpretability, robustness, and environmental impact; and, 
* Evaluation protocols for efficiency in NIR.


## Submission Guidelines and Review Process

All submissions must be in English (PDF format)  and formatted according to
the single column [CEUR-ART paper style](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/).
Unlike the main conference we do NOT require submissions to be anonymous.

We welcome poster proposals of up to 6 pages long, and articles between 10 and 20 pages long, excluding references.

Articles are expected to describe significant work towards efficient neural information access
systems as described in the topics of interest.  Furthermore, we welcome extensions or revisions of published articles.

Poster proposals are expected to describe work in progress, late-breaking results, new original ideas
and research vision, or any work which is better communicated through a visual, interactive format.
Please note, however, that we discourage posters which describe work at the proposal stage;
we expect at least some experimental analysis.

All submissions will go through a single-blind peer review process by the program committee
and judged on the basis of their relevance to the theme of the workshop and the depth of
their technical contribution. All accepted papers will be published in the workshop
proceedings (CEUR proceedings).

Submissions should be made electronically via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=reneuir2023).
