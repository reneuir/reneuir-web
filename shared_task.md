# Shared Task

ReNeuIR 2024 will have an shared task that aims to collect and measure neural IR systems to foster the development of new IR measures that incorporate efficiency and effectiveness. The methodology of the shared task was developed in the first two iterations of ReNeuIR, using (1) an unified hardware/execution environment, (2) handling effectiveness evaluation via existing evaluation tools and relevance judgments, and (3) ensuring that submitted systems follow a standardized workflow.
