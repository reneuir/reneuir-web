The second ReNeuIR Workshop will be co-located with SIGIR
in Taipei, Taiwan, in July 2023. The event aims to foster
discussion and collaboration  on holistic evaluation of
methods in the age of neural information  retrieval (NIR),
noting that efficacy matters but so does the computational
cost incurred to achieve it. In particular, the workshop promotes
the following notions and encourages the community to raise and
debate questions on the following themes:


* **Justification**: We believe it is important to justify the ever-growing model complexity through empirical analysis.

* **Training and inference efficiency**: We encourage the development of
models that require less data or computational resources for training and
fine-tuning, and that offer similarly fast inference. We also ask if there
are meaningful simplifications of the existing training processes or model
architectures that lead to comparable quality.

* **Evaluation and reporting**: We draw attention to the lessons learnt
from past IR studies and encourage a multi-faceted evaluation of NIR models
from quality to efficiency to environmental impact, and the design of
reusable models, benchmarks, and standardized metrics.
