# Call for Comments

One of the objectives of the ReNeuIR workshop is to promote a holistic evaluation
and a sustainable development of models in neural information retrieval (NIR),
noting that efficacy matters but so do the computational and environmental costs
incurred to achieve it. In particular, we draw attention to the lessons learnt
from past information retrieval studies and encourage a multi-faceted evaluation
of NIR models from quality to efficiency, and the design of reusable benchmarks
and standardized metrics.

To that end, the workshop will hold a panel discussion to allow participants to
brainstorm ideas and help set a new research agenda in this space. The goal of
this discussion is to find relevant, formal, and measurable targets to include
in our collective research agenda for the next year. To facilitate a meaningful
conversation, we seek comments, ideas, and proposals from the community prior to
the date of the workshop. We are interested in hearing your thoughts on the
following and related questions:

- **Benchmarking**: How do we set up a measurable and reproducible benchmarking platform?
What tasks and datasets would be most appropriate? What hardware should we adopt as
standard platforms? Can we borrow and extend to the NIR community ideas from similar
benchmarking efforts such as the Big ANN Benchmarks (https://big-ann-benchmarks.com/)?

- **Evaluation**: What metrics capture the various trade-offs pertinent to the objectives
of the workshop? When can we say that a system is sufficiently accurate and efficient?
Should we adopt a non-NIR system as a reference point for efficiency and/or effectiveness?

- **Environmental Impact**: How do we approach the challenge of quantifying the
environmental impact of the training and inference of NIR models? Should research
publications in the community be encouraged to report an estimate of the environmental
impact of proposed methods? How do we design metrics and tools to capture accurate
estimates to allow researchers to measure and report concrete quantities within
research publications?

- **Community Building**: What action do you see that can strengthen the research
community around this topic? Workshops? PhD summer schools? Publication of specific software?


Please send us a note at reneuir2022 [at] easychair [dot] org with
comments, ideas, and questions. We will invite contributors to
join us as co-authors of a SIGIR Forum submission later in the year.
